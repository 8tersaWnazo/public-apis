"Am Tag Als Ignatz Bubis Starb.mp3" is a song by Die HÃ¤rte, a German comedy rock band, that was released in 1999 as part of their album National Deutsche Welle[^1^]. The title translates to "The Day When Ignatz Bubis Died.mp3", and refers to the death of Ignatz Bubis, a prominent German Jewish leader and former president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, who passed away on August 13, 1999[^2^]. The song is a parody of Miley Cyrus's "Malibu", and uses the same melody and chorus, but with different lyrics that mock Bubis and his role in German politics and society.
 
The song has been widely criticized as antisemitic, hateful, and disrespectful to the memory of Bubis, who was a survivor of the Holocaust and a vocal advocate for Jewish rights and interfaith dialogue in Germany[^2^]. The song has also been associated with neo-Nazi groups, such as Zillertaler TÃ¼rkenjÃ¤ger & Landser, who have performed and uploaded their own versions of the song online[^3^]. The song has been banned from several platforms, such as YouTube and SoundCloud, for violating their terms of service and community guidelines[^4^]. However, some fans of Die HÃ¤rte have defended the song as a satire, a joke, or a form of artistic expression that should not be taken seriously or censored[^5^].

The controversy behind "Am Tag Als Ignatz Bubis Starb.mp3" reflects the ongoing debate about the limits of free speech, humor, and artistic creativity in relation to sensitive topics such as racism, antisemitism, and historical trauma. While some argue that such songs are harmless and entertaining, others contend that they are harmful and offensive. The song also raises questions about the responsibility of artists, platforms, and audiences in dealing with controversial content and its potential impact on society.
  
To understand the significance of "Am Tag Als Ignatz Bubis Starb.mp3", it is important to know more about the life and legacy of Ignatz Bubis. Bubis was born in 1927 in Breslau, Germany (now WrocÅaw, Poland), to a Polish Jewish family. He survived the Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II by hiding in various places, including a convent and a cemetery. He lost most of his relatives in the Holocaust, including his parents and two sisters. After the war, he moved to Frankfurt, where he became a successful businessman and a prominent member of the Jewish community. He was also involved in various social and political causes, such as supporting Israel, promoting German-Polish reconciliation, and fighting against racism and discrimination.
 
In 1992, Bubis was elected as the chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, the main representative body of Jews in Germany. He was later re-elected twice, and became the president of the council in 1998. As the leader of the council, he was often seen as the spokesperson for German Jews, and had a significant influence on German politics and public opinion. He was known for his outspokenness and courage in addressing controversial issues, such as antisemitism, neo-Nazism, Holocaust denial, German reunification, immigration, and multiculturalism. He also advocated for dialogue and cooperation among different religious and ethnic groups, and supported the integration of Jews into German society. He was respected by many political leaders, such as Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Roman Herzog, as well as by many religious leaders, such as Pope John Paul II and Dalai Lama.
 
Bubis died in 1999 at the age of 72 from a heart attack. His death was mourned by many people across Germany and beyond, who recognized his contributions to German democracy, human rights, and intercultural understanding. He was buried in Jerusalem, according to his wishes. His legacy is still remembered today by many organizations and institutions that bear his name or honor his memory, such as the Ignatz Bubis Bridge in Frankfurt, the Ignatz Bubis Prize for Understanding between Jews and Christians, and the Ignatz Bubis Lecture Series at Tel Aviv University.
